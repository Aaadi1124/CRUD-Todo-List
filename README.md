# CRUD-Todo-List
This is a Todo application using HTML &amp; CSS &amp; JavaScript, here we can edit and delete each item in the todo list as well as delete all the items in the list with the use of local storage so that all of our data will be stored in our browser even if we close the browser, we wonâ€™t be losing any data.  This also uses the search functionality to search the items in the list.
